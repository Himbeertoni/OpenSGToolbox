- tested on Linux only

- checkout 

  git://github.com/gerritvoss/OpenSGDevMaster_Toolbox.git

  and

  git://github.com/gerritvoss/OpenSGToolbox.git

- rename/copy the <OpenSG Root>/CMakeCacheInitial.txt.ref to  
  <OpenSG Root>/CMakeCacheInitial.txt and edit the file to match 
  your setup/paths

- run cmake to initially configure the build (note the CMakeCacheInitial.txt
  file is only read once during the first configure run), e.g.:

  on the same dir level as <OpenSG Root> do

  mkdir OpenSGDevMaster_Toolbox.build
  cd OpenSGDevMaster_Toolbox.build

  cmake ../OpenSGDevMaster_Toolbox.git

 - build

  this should build OpenSG with everything under 

  <Toolbox_Root>/Source/Base and
  <Toolbox_Root>/Source/System

  included.
